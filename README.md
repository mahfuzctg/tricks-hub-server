## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Provide the backend services for **Tricks Hub**, enabling user authentication, content management, and data storage for tech tips and interactions.
- **Core Functions**:
  - User registration and authentication with JWT.
  - CRUD operations for managing tech tips, posts, and content.
  - User interaction features like upvoting tips, commenting, and following users.
  - Integration with Stripe for handling premium content subscriptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine.
- MongoDB instance running (either locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tricks-hub-server.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd tricks-hub-backend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Development Server
Start the server with:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The server will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:

env
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
Environment Variables Explanation:
MONGODB_URI: The URI to connect to your MongoDB database.
JWT_SECRET: The secret key used to sign JWT tokens.
JWT_EXPIRE: Expiry duration for the JWT token.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: The base URL for the frontend to make API requests.
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Secret key for Stripe payment processing.
